                Hi, this is the page where I write all about myself but there isn't much to tell right now.
            </p>
                I'm just a 25 something old guy from the UK, I have always been interested in code and computing and took them as my favourite and main courses/lessons art school and college and seemed to do pretty well at them but had a horrible time sitting down and taking exams but with course work I was unstoppable! I didn't go to uni but I had a fairly decent job at the time so focused on that but it didn't give me any room to use, enjoy or work on my computing knowledge, except from a few times when I was able to bring small coding framework projects (proof of concepts idea's with hardcoded data - no links to the woks databases, unfortunately) to the companies IT team to help me and my co-workers with issues we had daily. These did get turned into simple projects that I helped design and oversee implementation to the company which I guess is something cool I achieved but apart from that couple times, I wasn't able to do much.
            </p>
            <p>
                So now after a few years slowly progressing at the same company my partner found the Odin project and wanted to give it a go-to help try and change industries and their job and I thought well I always wanted to get back into coding it had been a few good years since I had used any of my knowledge so best to start together (I ended up starting a few weeks behind but oh well) and start from the beginning making sure I had a good solid foundation of understanding and anything I might remember incorrectly could be updated, renewed and improved. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end that leads me to here, I'm enjoying this course and getting to work alongside my partner and getting to bounce our problems off each other has been a great help to us both in filling out our understanding of new concepts and any issues we get in trouble with. I also recently started streaming on Twitch and having fun there as well to help get better with presentation skills and generally getting better with networking, also, it's been fun learning and getting to know streaming software, surprisingly it's not as easy as it looks when you want to add in all the fancy bits!
            </p>

                P.S... I am really bad at spelling so I'm working on that too but I did run this page through the spell chek so it should be good!
